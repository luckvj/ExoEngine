## 🌌 What is ExoEngine?

**ExoEngine** is a next-generation Destiny 2 build discovery tool that transforms the overwhelming question *"What should I run?"* into an immersive visual experience. Instead of spreadsheets and lists, you explore a **3D galaxy of synergies** where every exotic, subclass, and mod is interconnected.

### 🎯 Built For:
- 🆕 **New Players** - Visual learning without the wiki rabbit hole
- 🎲 **Chaos Lovers** - Randomized meta builds for experienced Guardians
- 🔬 **Theorycrafters** - Deep synergy analysis with one-click equipping
- 🎨 **Build Collectors** - Save and share your discoveries

> **Note:** ExoEngine is a **companion tool** to DIM (Destiny Item Manager), not a replacement. DIM remains the gold standard for inventory management. We focus on **build discovery and visual storytelling**.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🌌 **Synergy Galaxy** - The Heart of ExoEngine

The **Synergy Galaxy** is a fully interactive 3D visualization where every piece of gear in your vault becomes a node in space. Connections represent synergies, and you can:

- 🔍 **Zoom & Navigate** - Fly through your entire arsenal in real-time
- 🎯 **Click to Equip** - One click transfers and equips items across characters
- 🕸️ **See Relationships** - Visual wires connect synergistic exotics, aspects, and fragments
- 🎨 **Color-Coded Elements** - Solar, Void, Arc, Stasis, Strand at a glance
- 🔄 **Live Inventory** - Real-time sync with Bungie's API
- 📱 **Mobile Optimized** - Touch controls for tablet gameplay

**How it works:**
1. Your entire vault loads as a 3D constellation
2. Equipped items are highlighted with glowing rings
3. Click any exotic to see its synergies light up
4. Click a synergy to auto-equip the full build
5. Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, double-tap to focus
